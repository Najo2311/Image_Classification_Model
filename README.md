# Image_Classification_Model
Casting Data_InceptionResNetV2 is a deep learning model designed for image classification tasks. This model utilizes the InceptionResNetV2 architecture, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines elements from both the Inception and ResNet architectures. 
The Inception model, formally known as GoogLeNet, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks. 
In ResNet (Residual Network), the key innovation lies in the introduction of residual blocks, which address the challenges of training very deep neural networks. The primary idea is to allow the network to learn residual functions with respect to the identity mapping, making it easier to train and converge as the network depth increases.
The goal is to provide a highly accurate and efficient solution for classifying images across various categories.
